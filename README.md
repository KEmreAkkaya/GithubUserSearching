# Github User Searching Site
This project is created to search users on Github.
This project has JavaScript/CSS/HTML contents.It hasn't RubyOnRails.
This project has CDN link for JS/JSON/JQuery/Bootstrap/fontawesome.

The goal of the this project is to search username on Github like www.github/username.If username exists,we'll go user's page ,if not we'll go error page .

Firstly , I created index.html for homepage.This page has point that user will make searching.So, We can get social media or homepage etc.
Secondly,I created error.html for error message.After I created CSS file for homepage and error page .
Thirdly,I created JavaScript file for button in index.html .If you press the button,page will redirect user's page on Github or error page.So, JavaScript file stored your searching user in localStorage.
